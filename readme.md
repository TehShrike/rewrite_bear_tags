## Do what

Find and replace in the text of all your Bear notes.

## Hol on

Change line 1 to have your own user directory name.

Change the regex/function on line 21-22 to meet your own find/replace needs.

You'll probably want to comment out the `overwrite_text` call while you're testing your regex.

```sh
npm i
node index.js
```
